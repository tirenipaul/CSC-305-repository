/* Pointers point to heaps
vec in principle incorporates pointers in a safe way because its a growable structure, so it allows you to grow the vector safely.
String is a smart pointer, a safe way of handling a collection of characters, those set are growable.
Smart pointers: Rc: Reference counter, mut x, ref cell, erc
//Error Handling: 
1.) panic => macro (panic!)
2.) Enum(s) like 
    => Option: Value(can be written as 'Some(val)') or None (no value)
    => Result: Value or Err(or)  (types)
*Blue Screen of death
Kernel loades the operating system; OS Kernel
Vec and vec!, vec! is the macro and Vec is the smart pointer
Eg, rec!((1, 3, "name"), (2, 5, "name")(....))
vec! works on Vec. It encapsulates all the Vec::new and so on that we would've had to do.
When you use the macro (vec!) to create, it gives you the opportunity to initialise with elements.
The outcome of popping can result in a given value or no value.
Equivalent of match is switch.

** y =v.pop().unwrap  . The v.pop() returns an option if we're right. If we're wrong, it'll panic without a repolrt as to why it's panicing.
   y = v.pop().expect("Mess up"). If wrong, it returns mess up.

** || -> Option<i32> {Some(v3.pop()? + 1)}; This returns the summation of the result of the pop and 1. It would be of type integer of 32 bytes. 
Options returns two things: Some(val) and None
Result returns two things: Okay and Error

If you feel the error may vary, you can define the error types ahead. For maintainance purposes, you want to codify errors
to make it easier by their number(or whatever you use to specify the errors) to know what could've gone wrong.

Ownership & Borrowing Illustrations
Rust doesn't do garbage collection. It automatically frees up memory that is not in use/ process.
Box, one owner
RC, multiple owners
Eg let a = 10; a here is the owner, and 10 is the value. a is occupying space somewhere; on the stack
let s = "test" goes to stack
let s = "test".to_owned(); goes to stack or heap
